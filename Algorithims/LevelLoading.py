 #It will need some work, the basic psuedo code is to have it pick a random starting point using random.randrange, multiply the quarter OR half values by 6, and then pick new starting points until they are within a certain range of eachother
 
 i = qAll.index
        for i in qAll(6):
            randomSpot = random.randrange(0,len(qAll))
            startCount = 1
            print("This is startinf point #" + startCount)
            startCount == startCount + 1
